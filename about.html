My name is Micky Jacosalem I'm 18 years old and live in Caloocan City I am the first born of my parents and we are four in number. My Father is a foreman and My Mother is a factory worker.
                <br>
               My favorite color is green, my Hobie is watching anime, I don't watch it all the time, I only do that when I finish my chores at home, I help my mother first before I do everything I want and before I use my cellphone . I want to play a basketball. After I finish my homework, my brothers and I play basketball every morning. As for the subjects, I'm pretty good at it, so I can't do everything, I'm not good at it, I just know what I've learned.
